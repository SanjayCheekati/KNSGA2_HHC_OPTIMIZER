1.  Introduction

Home Health Care (HHC) is defined as a set of caregivers providing a wide range of medical
and paramedical services for patients in their homes such as nursing, drug delivery and medical
assistance,  etc.  In  France,  HHC  is  gaining  more  importance  within  the  European  healthcare
system. According to the official key numbers of Hospitalization, 128000 patients have benefited
of HHC services and 5.9 million days of home hospitalization have been achieved in 285 HHC
companies in 2019.

Reducing  operating  costs  and  providing  high-quality  of  services  are  the  main  objectives  of

HHC companies. Costs are mainly influenced by two parameters: the total travelled distance or
time  and  the  total  time  required  by  the  HHC  staff  to  perform  medical  tasks.  Therefore,  HHC
companies  face  two  problems,  which  are  the  staff  scheduling  and  the  routing  problems.  The
combined routing and scheduling problem has become a relevant issue in several research fields,
especially  in  HHC  sector.  Routing  and  scheduling  problem  are  well  known  as  combinatorial
optimization  problems.  HHC  decision-makers  are  confronted  with  multiple  and  complex
decisions that are often contradictory, including the optimization of staff travelling distance and
assignment  of  staff  to  patients.  Several  constraints  are  taking  into  account,  such  as,  workload
balancing  and  patient  preferences,  etc.  Many  studies  have  focused  on  healthcare  optimization
problems, in particular (Augusto & Xie, 2009) (Tlahig et al., 2009) (Ben Houria et al., 2016), etc.
Inspired  by  this  point,  this  work  suggests  a  new  bi-objective  optimization  model  to  the  HHC
routing  and  scheduling  problem,  called  HHC-  MOVRPTW.  The  considered  problem  is  defined
as  a  set  of  caregivers  visiting  patients  at  their  homes  to  perform  medical  tasks  with  taking  into
consideration  several  constraints  especially  the  visiting  time  preferences.  This  problem  is
considered  as  an  extension  of  the  famous  vehicle  routing  problem  with  time  windows.  HHC-
MOVRPTW aims to minimize the overall service time, required to perform all medical tasks by
caregivers  at  homes  of  patients,  while  minimizing  the  total  delays  that  represents  the  time
difference  between  all  services  start-  times  and  patients  visiting-time  preferences.  In  practice,
both objectives tend to minimize operational costs and maximize the satisfaction of patients by
arriving  on  time.  Solving  more  than  one  objective  consists  of  finding  a  set  of  good  solutions
(trade-offs), known as the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. In the literature, there are many works
proposing  exact  and  heuristic  methods  to  solve  multi-objective  problems.  In  this  paper,  three
solution  approaches  are  proposed  to  solve  HHC-MOVRPTW.  First,  a  non-scalar  method,
lexicographic  method  is  suggested  in  order  to  find  a  first  solution  for  the  problem.  Then,  two
well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (Deb, 2001) and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (Zitzler et al., 2001) are
also suggested to solve the proposed model with instances of large size, taken from the literature.
The  third  solution  approach  is  a  hybridization  between  the  two  multi-objective  evolutionary
algorithms  (NSGA-II  and  SPEA2)  and  the  K-means  clustering  approach.  The  main  idea  of
applying  K-means  clustering  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  obtained  Pareto  sets  in  terms  of
convergence and diversity. the set of patients to be visited (input data) is divided into k similar
clusters  through  K-means,  where  k  is  a  predefined  number  of  clusters,  that  corresponds  to  the
number  of  caregivers.  Evolutionary  algorithms  have  to  be  simulated  with  each  cluster  data  in
order  to  obtain  the  optimal  route  of  each  caregiver.  Afterwards,  the  obtained  Pareto  sub-set
(partial solutions) have to be combined in order to form the global Pareto set.

This  work  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  2  summarizes  the  recent  works  on  home  health
care  problems  and  multi-objective  optimization  problems.  The  proposed  optimization  model  is
presented  in  section  3.  Solution  approaches  are  described  in  section  4.  Section  5  provides  and
analysis the experimental results. Section 6 concludes the paper.

2.  Literature Review

This section provides an overview of previous research and basic aspects on the home health

care routing and scheduling problem, as well as the multi-objective optimization problems.

2.1.  Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem



In  home  health  care  operations,  a  medical  staff  is  scheduled  and  routed  by  planners  to
perform medical and paramedical services at patients’ homes. This topic is called Home Health
Care Routing and Scheduling Problem (HHCRSP). It is defined in the literature as a combination
of two sub-problems, the vehicle routing problem and the personnel scheduling problem (Cheng
&  Rich,  1998)  (Nickel  et  al.,  2009)  (Jemai  et  al.,  2013)  (Mankowska  et  al.,  2014)  (Yu  &  Gen,
2010)  (Cococcioni  et  al.,  2018)  (Cholodowicz  &  Orlowski,  2017)  (Mascolo  et  al.,  2021).  Such
optimization problem has a significant impact since many decades, solving a HHCRSP consists
of finding the shortest routes for a medical staff while respecting several operational constraints.
However,  the  Vehicle  Routing  Problem  (VRP)  is  a  combinatorial  optimization  problem,
proposed  by  Dantzig  and  Ramser  in  1959.  It  consists  of  finding  the  optimal  routes  between  a
central depot and a set of customers, for a set of homogeneous vehicles. Each customer should be
visited  by  exactly  one  vehicle  and  all  vehicles  must  start  and  finish  their  routes  at  the  depot
(Bansal & Goel, 2018), (Elshaer & Awad, 2020). VRP was described as a generalized problem of
travelling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  that  consists  of  designing  the  shortest  route  for  a  salesman.
The  classical  VRP  has  been  extended  in  several  variants  by  introducing  additional  real-life
constraints. According to (Kumar & Panneerselvam, 2012) and (Shi-Yi & Wei-Chang, 2021), the
most popular variants are VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW), VRP with Pickup and Delivery
(VRPPD),  Stochastic  VRP  (SVRP),  the  Multi-Depot  VRP  (MDVRP).  Recently  the  Electric
Vehicle Charging Scheduling (EVCS) is also considered among the most common variants as in
(Liu et al., 2019). In VRPTW, each vehicle should deliver goods to customers within a specific
time interval. In the literature, there are two types of VRPTW. VRPTW with soft time window
(VRPSTW)  where  the  time  windows  are  allowed  but  associated  with  penalty  costs  (Li  et  al.,
2015), (Iqbal et al., 2015) and VRP with hard time window (VRPHTW), in which any delay is
allowed  to  the  time  window  (Miranda  &  Conceição,  2016)  (Hu  et  al.,  2018).  In  the  VRP  with
Pick-Up  and  Delivery  (VRPPD),  vehicles  transport  goods  from  a  single  depot  to  all  customers
and also from customers to the depot. Customers that receive goods from the depot are known as
deliveries  and  customers  who  send  goods  are  pickups.  There  are  two  sub-classes  of  VRPPD.
Single  demands,  in  which,  customers  are  either  pure  deliveries  or  pure  pickups  (Nagy  et  al.,
2015) and combined demands, where customers send and receive goods. (Kalayci & Kaya, 2016)
(Avci & Topaloglu, 2016). The Stochastic VRP (SVRP) has one or several random components.
it  is  an  extension  of  VRP  with  stochastic  (e.g.  demand,  customers,  travel  or  service  times)
(Marinakis  &  Marinaki,  2015).  In  Multiple-Depots  VRP  (MDVRP),  more  than  one  depot  is
considered  (Montoya-Torres  et  al.,  2015).  VRP  and  its  variants  have  been  widely  studied  and
applied in many real-life applications, such as transportation, communication and healthcare, etc.
(Elshaer  &  Awad,  2020),  (Hameed,  2020)  and  (Hornstra  et  al.,  2020).  VRP  is  an  NP-hard
problem.  Hence,  exact  methods  are  only  efficient  for  small  problem  instances  and  may  be
difficult  to  solve  these  problems  in  accept-  able  process  time.  Therefore,  Heuristics  and
metaheuristics  are  more  suitable  for  real-world  applications.  On  the  other  hand,  Scheduling
Personnel  is  a  widely  studying  area  and  has  an  important  role  in  manufacturing  sector.  It  was
introduced in the 1950s by (Dantzig, 1954) and (Edie, 1954). Personnel scheduling studies have
focused on the assignment of tasks to employees, where the main objectives are to optimize the
resource  utilization  and  to  ensure  an  equitably  workload  distribution.  Scheduling  problems  are
divided  into  static  and  dynamic  problems.  The  Static  scheduling  cannot  be  changed  over  time.
This  may  be  different  from  employee  to  employee  for  each  day  of  the  week,  but  the  shift  start
and end times are the same for each employee from week to week. While dynamic planning is
variable  over  time  (Özder  et  al.,  2020).  Personnel  scheduling  problems  consist  of  various


decisions that have to be taken, such as the assignment of tasks (e.g. employee A is assigned to
job  J).  However,  the  group  decision  includes  a  number  of  different  decisions  where  employees
are combined into subsets, such as skills and different locations. For each decision, it is important
to  distinguish  between  individual  personnel  members  and  teams  (Bergh  et  al.,  2013).  In  HHC
sector,  personnel  require  transportation  to  perform  services  at  different  locations,  such  as
caregivers visiting patients at their homes (Castillo-Salazar et al., 2012)  (Castillo-Salazar et al.,
2012)  .  These  problems  are  referred  in  the  literature  as  workforce  routing  and  scheduling
problems.  Employees  travel  by  diverse  means  of  transportation,  e.g.  walking,  car,  public
transport,  bicycle,  etc.  Additionally,  they  have  time  window  limitations  regarding  the  daily
workload  or  their  starting  and  ending  times  (Castillo-Salazar  et  al.,  2016).  Many  types  of
workforce  scheduling  and  routing  problem  are  discussed  since  the  last  decencies,  whether  for
individual employees or teams (Gayraud et al., 2013) and (Issaoui et al., 2015) have focused on
nurse  scheduling  problem  while  (Issabakhsh  et  al.,  2018)  and  (Issabakhsh  et  al.,  2018)  have
proposed  optimization  models  for  HHC  staff  (nurses,  doctors,  delivery  men  and  technicians).
Personnel  scheduling  is  based  on  mathematical  techniques  and  optimization  approaches  to
improve  resource  allocation.  The  personnel  scheduling  problems  are  mainly  solved  by  exact
methods,  heuristic  and  metaheuristic  algorithms  or  both  (Bergh  et  al.,  2013).  Unlike  classical
optimization approaches, the hybrid methods have achieved great success in a several areas due
to  their  effectiveness  in  combining  two  or  more  components.  The  main  objective  of  the  hybrid
approaches  is  to  take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  each  component.  In  the  literature,  there  are
many  hybrid  approaches  that  have  been  proposed  to  deal  with  scheduling  problems,  such  as  in
(Zhou et al., 2019), (Belhor et al., 2020), (Zhao et al., 2020), (Frazzon et al., 2018), (Zhao et al.,
2021), (Arora & Banyal, 2022) (Belhor et al., 2023).

2.2.  Multi-Objective Optimization Problem

Modelling  the  appropriate  mathematical  formulation  for  an  optimization  problem  is  an
important  and  critical  step  before  optimization  step  itself  (Branke  et  al.,  2008;  Coello  et  al.,
2001). Optimization problem involves to find the best solution (the maximum or minimum value
of  some  objective  function)  from  all  feasible  solutions.  Many  decision  and  planning  problems
involve multiple conflicting objectives that should be considered simultaneously. Multi-objective
optimization (MOO) involves more than one objective function to be simultaneously optimized.
Solving  a  multi-objective  optimization  problem  (MOOP)  implies  obtaining  best  solutions,  so-
called Pareto optimal solutions. MOOP received much attention in recent years due to their wide
applicability in the most of real-world applications, especially in the HHC sector, where optimal
decisions  must  be  made,  taking  into  account  trade-offs  between  two  or  more  conflicting
objectives (Emmerich & Deutz, 2018). After finding the set of optimal solutions, HHC decision-
makers choose the appropriate one according to their preferences (Pappalardo, 2008).

In  the  literature,  many  works  have  dealt  with  MOOP  in  HHC  area.  (Lin  et  al.,  2015)  have
suggested  a  multi-objective  optimization  mathematical  model  for  constructing  weekly
assignment  for  therapists,  solved  by  an  exact  method.  (Li  et  al.,  2015)  have  proposed  a  multi-
objective  model  for  the  HHCRSP  which  aims  to  maximize  the  satisfaction  of  care-  givers  and
patients  while  minimizing  the  operating  costs.  (Braekers  et  al.,  2016)  have  proposed  a  bi-
objective optimization model for HHCRSP. They have solved the model by a new metaheuristic
approach based on neighborhood search heuristic. (Alves et al., 2019) have worked on HHCRSP
and proposed a multi-objective approach based on Tchebycheff method and a Genetic algorithm
to solve the proposed model. (Decerle et al., 2019) have  formulated  a multi-objective model to


deal  with  the  HHCRSP,  solved  by  a  memetic  algo-  rithm.  (Fathollahi-Fard  et  al.,  2021)  have
suggested  a  multi-objective  robust  optimization  of  the  HHC  which  is  multi-depot,  multi-period
and  multi-service.  MOOP  is  based  on  the  Pareto  dominance  concept,  which  consists  of
comparing two objective vectors in a precise sense (Cholodowicz & Orlowski, 2017). In MOOP,
the  concept  of  dominance  is  useful  to  compare  two  solution  candidates
  and  to
determinate if one of these solutions is dominated by the other one. Researchers in MOOP aim to
obtain good trade-offs so-called Pareto optimum (Coello et al., 2001; Király et al., 2011). Given

The non-dominated solutions are not dominated by any other solution. The Pareto set is a set
of non-dominated solutions in the decision space. The Pareto front presents the image of Pareto
set in the objective space. The selection of solutions is made according to the solutions ranking
(e.g. objective 1 is more important than objective 2).

2.2.1.  Multiobjective Vehicle Routing Problem

Multi-objective VRP (MOVRP) is a NP Hard problem in which at least two objectives have
to be optimized. These objectives are often conflicting. Solving a MOVRP involves a set of non-
dominated solutions. In the literature, there are three ways to formulated MOVRP. The first one
consists  of  extending  classical  VRP  by  adding  new  objectives  (Baños  et  al.,  2013)  (Chiang  &
Hsu,  2014).  The  second  one  is  a  generalization  of  VRP  that  consists  of  replacing  some
constraints  by  objective  functions  (e.g.  the  time  window  constraint  is  often  replaced  by  an
objective function) (Ayadi & Benadada, 2013), (Ghannadpour et al., 2014) and (Kaiwartya et al.,
2015).  While  the  third  one  defines  new  objectives  from  real-life  cases  such  as  in  (Gupta  et  al.,
2010),  (Wang  et  al.,  2016)  and  (Melián-Batista  et  al.,  2014).  There  are  two  main  approaches
dealing with MOOPs. The first one is called conventional technique that converts the MOOP into
single-objective  and  considers  the  rest  of  objectives  as  constraints  (Jayamoorthi  et  al.,  2017).
While the second one is called evolutionary based technique that is well suited to solve several
complex multi-objective problems. They generate non-dominated solutions after each iteration.

There  is  also  another  classification  of  solution  approaches  to  solve  MOVRP  (Elshaer  &
Awad,  2020).  The  Pareto  methods  are  the  most  popular  and  frequently  used  with  evolutionary
algorithms  (Castro-Gutierrez  et  al.,  2011),  (Baños  et  al.,  2013),  (Chiang  &  Hsu,  2014).  Scalar
Methods  consist  of  solving  the  MOVRP  by  an  exact  concept,  such  as  weighted  linear
aggregation, ε-constraint methods, goal programming, etc. (Ghoseiri & Ghannadpour, 2010). The
third  category  is  called  Non-Pareto  and  Non-Scalar  Methods.  These  methods  deal  with  several
objectives separately. They  are based on metaheuristic approaches such  as Genetic Algorithms,
Ant Colony etc. (Zou et al., 2013), (Chávez et al., 2016).

2.2.2.  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary  algorithms  are  shown  as  an  important  optimization  and  search  methods  in  the
last decade. They have a great success in solving widely used optimization problems and able to
be  successfully  used  in  many  applications  of  high  complexity.  Multiobjective  Evolutionary
algorithms  (MOEAs)  have  the  same  success  in  both  scientific  research  and  engineering
applications  (Yu  &  Gen,  2010)  (Castillo-Salazar  et  al.,  2016).  They  are  able  to  find  several




optimal solutions with a good spread in a single run of the algorithm.

The  process  of  MOEA  begins  with  a  randomly  initial  population  with  fixed  size.  This
population  has  to  be  evaluated  by  a  fitness  assignment  value  and  efficient  solutions  have  to  be
chosen  after  that.  However,  the  reproduction  of  each  solution  is  given  by  genetic  operators
especially  the  crossover  and  the  mutation  operators,  in  order  to  generate  new  offspring.  At  the
final  step,  best  solutions  will  be  selected  from  the  offspring  and  the  parents.  The  MOEAs  are
mainly based on three components (Deb, 2001):
-  The  “fitness”  assignment:  allows  better  convergence  towards  optimal  Pareto  solutions.
Among  the  best-known  fitness  assignment  approaches,  we  can  cite  the  “dominance-based
approach”.
-  Diversity  preservation:  generate  a  diverse  set  of  Pareto  solutions.  For  example:  the  “nearest
neighbor” method and the “Crowding Distance” method.
-  Elitism: keeps the best solutions found during the search process.

In the literature, there are many MOEA algorithms, such as NPGA - Niched Pareto Genetic
Algorithm (1994), NPGA II (2001), NSGA- Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (1995),
NSGA-II (2000), SPEA - Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (1998), SPEA 2 (2001), PESA
-  Pareto  Envelope-based  Selection  Algorithm  (2000),  PESA  II  (2001)  and  MPGA  -  Multi-
Population  Genetic  Algorithm  (2003).  A  summary  of  these  algorithms  and  a  comparison  study
between them are provided by (Kunkle, 2005).

From  the  experiments  conducted  by  (Zitzler  et  al.,  2001)  on  various  combinatorial  and
continuous  optimization  problems,  it  was  proved  that  SPEA2  and  NSGA-II  achieved  the  best
performance  compared  to  other  MOEAs.  In  addition,  many  works  from  various  fields  of
application  have  also  proven  their  effectiveness,  including  (Zitzler  et  al.,  2001),  (King  et  al.,
2010),  (Lee  et  al.,  2011),  (Bandyopadhyay  &  Bhattacharya,  2014),  (Cholodowicz  &  Orlowski,
2017)  and  (Kaucic  et  al.,  2019).  However,  there  are  similar  recent  works  dealing  with  the
problem of vehicle routing in the field of HAD, such as (Ait Haddadene et al., 2019) and (Xiang
et al., 2021). In this paper, a new hybrid approach based on MOEAs is proposed to deal with the
HHCRSP.

3.  Problem Description and Mathematical Formulation

In  this  section,  a  bi-objective  mathematical  model,  called  HHC-MOVRPTW  is  proposed  to
deal with the HHCRSP that can be seen as a variant of VRP with soft time windows (VRPTW).
The time window is defined by patients but caregivers can arrive before or after the visiting time
preference with a penalty cost.

HHC-MOVRPTW  aims  to  optimize  both  objectives  simultaneously.  The  first  objective
function  aims  to  minimize  the  overall  service  time  which  include  the  travel  times  and  the
working times. The second objective function attempts to minimize the difference between start-
time  of  services  and  visiting  time  preferences  of  patients.  Constraint  (4)  guarantees  that  all
caregivers visit the HHC depot (node 0). Constraint (5) ensures that  each patient is assigned to
exactly  one  caregiver.  Constraint  (6)  forces  each  caregiver  to  be  assigned  to  a  limited  and
predefined number of patients. Constraint (7) and Constraint (8) guarantee that all caregivers start
and finish their services at the HHC depot. Constraint (9) forces each caregiver to visit a given
number  of  paths.  Constraint  (10)  ensures  that  each  caregiver  crosses  a  path  exactly  once.
Constraint  (11)  guarantees  that  caregiver’s  working  time  may  not  exceed  the  maximum





































workload. Constraint (12) ensures, for each caregiver, that the total quantity of drugs requested
by  his  patients  does  not  exceed  his  vehicle’s  capacity.  For  each  two  patients  successively
assigned  to  the  same  caregiver,  constraint  (13)  ensures  that  the  following  service  cannot  begin
until  after  the  completion  of  the  leading  service.  Constraint  (14)  guarantees  that  the  service
begins  within  an  interval  (the  service  cannot  begin  before  the  earliest  start-time  and  after  the
latest  start-time).  Constraint  (15)  eliminates  the  sub-  tours.  Constraint  (16)  and  Constraint  (17)
indicate that decision variables
 are binary. Constraint (18) indicates that the effective
service start-time

 and
 must be positive.

4. Solution Approaches

This  section  introduces  the  proposed  solution  approach.  Three  ways  are  suggested  to  deal
with  the  HHC-MOVRPTW,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  The  proposed  solution  approach  is
composed  of  three  phases.  In  phase  I,  a  non-scalar  method,  called  lexicographic  method,  is
suggested to solve the HHC-MOVRPTW.

In phase II, two well-known MOEAs, namely NSGA-II and the SPEA2, are implemented to
solve  the  problem.  Subsequently,  each  of  these  two  MOEAs  is  combined  with  K-means
clustering  approach  in  phase  III,  to  improve  the  quality  of  Pareto  sets  obtained  in  phase  II.  In
fact,  to  solve  a  multi-objective  optimization  problem,  there  are  two  categories  of  resolution
methods:  conventional  and  evolutionary  techniques.  The  lexicographic  method  belongs  to
conventional techniques that converts the MOOP into single-objective problem and considers the
rest of objectives as constraints. It can be shown as an “a priori” approach in which the objectives
are ranked according to the preferences of decision makers. The main advantage of this method is
its  simplicity  and  computational  efficiency  (Pinchera  et  al.,  2017),  (Cococcioni  et  al.,  2018).
While MOEAs belong to Pareto-based approach, that optimize simultaneously several objectives,
often  contradictory,  by  comparing  and  raking  the  solutions  according  to  the  concept  of
dominance.

4.1.  MOEA for HHC-MOVRPTW

Figure 1: Structure of NSGA-II

Based  on  the  experiments  carried  out  by  (Zitzler  et  al.,  2001)  on  various combinatorial  and
continuous optimization problems, it has been proven that SPEA2 and NSGA-II have  achieved
the  best  performance  compared  to  other  MOEAs.  In  addition,  various  related  works  have  also




proven  their  effectiveness,  such  as  (Gadhvi  et  al.,  2016),  (Cholodowicz  &  Orlowski,  2017),
(Kaucic  et  al.,  2019),  (Ait  Haddadene  et  al.,  2019)  and  (Xiang  et  al.,  2021).  For  these  reason,
NSGA-II and SPEA2 are chosen to solve the HHC-MOVRPTW.

4.1.1.  Non-dominated Sorting GA

The  non-dominated  sorting  GA  (NSGA-II)  was  firstly  proposed  by  (Deb,  2001).  It  is  an
improved version of non-dominated sorting GA (NSGA), proposed by  (Srinivas & Deb, 1995).
NSGA-II  has  successfully  addressed  multi-objective  optimization  on  several  benchmark
problems.  NSGA-II  decomposes  the  population  into  Pareto  fronts,  using  the  notion  of
dominance, to classify the solutions. Each front is composed of solutions having the same rank.
The  first  one  is  composed  of  all  the  non-dominated  solutions,  the  second  front  contains  the
solutions which are only dominated by the solutions of the first front and the last front contains
the solutions dominated by all other solutions of other fronts. This step is necessary to select the
individuals  for  the  reproduction  step,  which  will  allow  to  proceed  to  the  next  iteration  of  the
algorithm. The popularity of NSGA-II is related to its computational complexity which is lower
than that of NSGA:
, where M corresponds to the number of objectives and
N is the size of the population (Deb, 2001). In the first generation, NSGA-II randomly generates
a population of a fixed size. This population is composed of a set of chromosomes, each of which
represents a solution to the problem. In this work, the chromosome is represented by a numerical
vector, where each number inside corresponds to a given patient. The chromosome is consisting
of  the  routes  that  vehicles  must  travel.  In  the  present  work,  the  chromosome  representation  is
inspired by the multi-chromosome technique of (Király et al., 2011) as shown in Figure 2. Due to
the problem constraints, each gene should appear exactly once in the chromosome. However, all
routes  must  start  and  end  at  the  depot  (node  0).  Thereby,  all  genes  (0)  are  excluded  from  the
chromosome, as shown in Figure 2, but they are taken into account when calculating the fitness
function. Due to the workload balancing constraint, and due to the workload balancing constraint,
patients have to be fairly divided between caregivers.

4.1.2.  Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm

Figure 2: chromosome representation

The  Strength  Pareto  Evolutionary  Algorithm  2  (SPEA2)  was  proposed  by  (Zitzler  et  al.,
2001), extended of SPEA (Zitzler & Thiele, 1999). The SPEA2 starts with an initial population
with fixed size and an empty archive (external set). Then, it separates the non-dominated set from
the  population  solutions.  The  fitness  of  each  solution  is  calculated  according  to  the  number  of
dominated  and  dominating  solutions.  It  copies  the  front  of  non-  dominated  solutions  in  the
archive  and  generates  new  solutions  using  the  genetic  operators.  Finally,  it  selects  the  best
candidates according to their density values. Each solution

is  stopped  when  the  number  of  non-dominated  solutions  is  equal  to  the  archive  list  size.
Otherwise, if the non-dominated front is too large compared to the archive, the individuals of the
next  generation  are  deleted  iteratively  by  choosing  at  each  iteration  the  individual  who  has  the
minimum distance from another individual. This procedure ends when the non-dominated front
fits exactly into the archive. When the non-dominated front is too small compared to the archive,
the best dominated individuals in the previous population are copied to the new archive until the
non-dominated front has the same size compared to the archive. According to (Zitzler & Thiele,

4.2.  K-means Clustering Algorithm

Clustering  Algorithm  is  an  unsupervised  classification  technique  used  in  scientific  and
industrial  applications.  It  is  a  technique  that  consists  of  classifying  similar  objects  into  groups,
called  clusters.  K-means  is  one  of  the  most  popular  clustering  algorithms  that  aims  to  assign  a
given  set  of  data  points  into  k  clusters  (Mousa  et  al.,  2017).  The  term  "K-means"  was  first
introduced by (Macqueen, 1967). The main steps of K-means are described as Figure 3. First, it
fixes  the  number  of  clusters
o
initial centroids for the
 clusters. Then, it calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Square (WCSS)
of  all  the  points  relative  to  the  cluster’s  centroid.  K-means  assigns  the  points  to  the  closest
cluster, then it recalculates the new centroids. these steps are repeated until no point changes its
cluster. In this work, K-means methods allows to divide the set of patients into similar clusters,
where  each  of  them  corresponds  to  a  caregiver.  Each  cluster  contains  a  sub-set  of  population,
which have to be visited by a given caregiver. The main objective is to find the minimum WCSS
between patients and centroids. It is important to note that K-means can be defined as following
equation:

  to  partition  a  set  of  points.  It  starts  by  randomly  choosing

4.3.  Hybrid MOEA for HHC-MOVRPTW

The  new  hybrid  approach  that  combines  MOEA  with  K-means,  is  called  K-MOEA  and

described by Algorithm 1.

As  illustrated  by  Figure  4,  the  K-MOEA  is  composed  of  two  stages.  In  the  decomposition
stage, the set of patients (population) is divided into K clusters (sub-populations) through the K-
means  method.  Knowing  that  K  corresponds  to  the  number  of  caregivers.  In  this  work,  the
patients  belonging  to  the  same  cluster  have  similar  characteristics,  such  as  geographical
coordinates  and  visiting-time  preferences.  Thus,  the  K  sub-populations  are  considered  as  input
data for the NSGA-II and SPEA2.







Figure 4: Structure of K-MOEA

o = 1 … x

The output of this stage is a K Pareto subsets, where each one corresponds to a sub-solution
to  the  problem.  In  other  words,  each  kth  Pareto  subset  is  composed  of  a  set  of  non-dominated
solutions for the kth caregiver, with
. Each non-dominated solution is represented by a
pair of values. The first one shows the minimum service time (first objective) while the second
indicates the total time difference compared to the patients’ time preferences (second objective).
In the combination stage, the K Pareto subsets have to be recombined to form the global Pareto
front, consisting of non-dominated solutions for the problem. However, all Pareto subsets should
have the same size. In order to obtain the global Pareto front, the K Pareto subsets should have
the same size. Thus, according to the smallest size of the Pareto subsets, which is referred T, k
new Pareto subsets of size T are randomly generated from the k current ones. In other words, T
non-dominated  solutions  are  randomly  generated  from  each  Pareto  subset  to  form  new  ones  of
size  T.  Afterwards,  all  new  Pareto  subsets  are  combined  by  equation  (28),  that  consists  of
combining the objective values, obtained by solutions of order t of all Pareto subsets, where

Intel(R)  Core(TM)  i7-1165G7  CPU  computer  under  Windows  11  with  16  GB  of  RAM.  The
lexicographic  method  is  encoded  in  java,  using  the  Localsolver  optimization  library.  In  the
literature,  there  is  no  standard  benchmark  for  the  considered  problem.  Therefore,  40  test
instances  are  generated  from  Solomon’s  VRPTW  benchmark2  with  different  sizes  (25,  50  and
100  customers)  and  different  types  (R,  C  and  RC).  In  this  work,  customers  correspond  to
patients. The service time is predefined for all instances and equal to 20 minutes. The travel time
between patients is measured in minutes.

Firstly, the HHC-MOVRPTW is solved with the lexicographical method in order to obtain a
first solution to the problem and then compare it with solutions obtained by Pareto methods. This

method  is  simulated  with  2  orders.  In  order  1,  the  first  objective  is  preferred  over  the  second.
While order 2 corresponds to the opposite case. Thus, the lexicographical method is simulated 2
times, using the 40 test instances and repeated 20 times in order to diversify the search space and
to  get  better  solutions.  A  limit  CPU  time  is  required  for  each  run.  So,  the  proposed  model  is
simulated  with  20  different  CPU  times.  In  total,
  runs  are  performed  with
the  lexicographical  method.  Afterwards,  the  proposed  model  is  simulated  with  both  algorithms
NSGA-II and SPEA-2 which are configured with the same parameters. For each algorithm, a set
of  20  runs  are  performed,  using  40  test  instances  with  an  initial  population  of  size=100,  a
crossover rate of 0.7 and a mutation rate of 0.2. The maximal number of generations is fixed to
1000 generations per run. In total,
 runs have been carried out. For each test
instance, 20 Pareto fronts are obtained, where each one contains a set of non-dominated solutions
for the problem. Each solution is composed of two values. The first one indicates the minimum
total service time whereas the second one indicates the minimum total difference between start-
time  of  services  and  patients’  visiting-time  preferences.  Subsequently,  the  proposed  hybrid
algorithms K- NSGA-II and K-SPEA2 are configured with the same parameters of NSGA-II and
SPEA2, in order to ensure a fair comparison between the results obtained by the four algorithms.
However, the number of instances being important, it cannot be possible to expose the results of
all instances. Therefore, only 6 test instances of different size (25, 50 and 100) and type (C, R,
RC)  have  been  selected  for  testing.  Thereby,  each  algorithm  is  simulated  20  times  with  6
instances. In each run, the number of clusters (K) is changed in order to find the optimal one for
the  decomposition  phase.  The  output  of  this  phase  is  a  K  Pareto  subsets,  which  have  to  be
recombined to form the global Pareto front.

The  computational  results  show  that  for  the  majority  of  instances,  solutions  of  order  1  are
better than those of order 2. Taking the example of instances C201.25, R109.100, and RC208.50,
  and
solutions  of  order  1  are  strictly  inferior  than  those  of  order  2:

However,  the  lexicographical  method  divides  the  problem  into  multiple  mono-objective
problems  to  obtain  a  unique  solution  to  the  considered.  Nevertheless,  it  tends  to  privilege  one
objective over the others, which makes the search space converge towards a particular direction.
In addition to the lexicography method, K-NSGA-II and K-SPEA2 are implemented to solve the
HHC-MOVRPTW,  as  well  as  their  original  versions  NSGA-II  and  SPEA2.  Unlike  the
lexicographic method, these algorithms provide a set of non-dominated solutions to the problem.

Table 2 presents for each test instance, the number of non-dominated solutions (size of the Pareto
front  |PF|)  found  by  the  two  NSGA-II  and  SPEA2  algorithms,  as  well  as  the  CPU  time.  The
results are presented by minimum, maximum and average values which are found over 20 runs.
According to these results, it was observed that NSGA-II takes about 4 to 15 seconds to find a
solution  to  the  problem,  while  SPEA2  takes  between  6  and  20  seconds  to  solve  it.  However,
SPEA2 is more expensive in run-time than NSGA-II with an average extra-time of around 5000
ms.  This  is  due  to  the  computational  complexity  of  the  archiving  procedure  of  SPEA2.  This
observation  was  also  highlighted  in  (Deb  et  al.,  2003).  In  contrast,  NSGA-II  found  more
solutions  on  the  Pareto  front  (in  62.5%  of  instances),  compared  to  SPEA2.  Regarding  to  K-
NSGA-II  and  K-SPEA2,  the  results  of  the  decomposition  phase  are  shown  in  Table  3  that
indicates for each instance, the number of clusters, the number of elements that compose it, the
CPU  time  (minimum,  maximum  and  average)  as  well  as  the  sizes  of  Pareto  fronts  (minimum,
maximum and average). Knowing that the first cluster of each instance contains a single element,
corresponding to the HHC-depot.

In  this  work,  we  consider  only

  clusters  (except  the  first  one).  However,  the  depot  is
only  taken  into  account  when  calculating  the  fitness  function.  Thus,  in  56%  of  instances,  the
  obtained  by  K-NSGA-II  is  larger  than  that  obtained  by  K-
average  size  of  Pareto
SPEA2.  In  addition,  it  is  observed  that  K-NSGA-II  is  faster  than  K-SPEA2  in  all  instances.
Based  on  these  results,  it  is  important  to  choose  the  best  Pareto  fronts  for  the  combi-  nation
phase. Therefore, a performance study is carried out to evaluate the quality of the Pareto fronts.
In the literature, there are several multi-objective quality indicators (Zitzler et al., 2003) that can
be  distinguished  according  to  the  performance  objective.  Either  the  convergence  towards  the
optimal  Pareto  front  and/or  the  diversity  of  solutions  on  the  Pareto  front.  In  this  work,  three
performance indicators are used to compare Pareto fronts. Two indicators evaluate the diversity
of solutions, while the third one measures the convergence:

|’W|

  identifies  the  number  of  non-dominated  solutions  belonging  to  the  first

-  The  metric
Pareto front. The larger the number, the Pareto has better diversity.
-  The Spacing metric
 is proposed by  (Schott, 1995).  It makes it possible to measure the
diversity  of  non-dominated  solutions  belonging  to  the  same  Pareto,  by  comparing  the  uniform
distribution  and  the  deviation  of  the  solutions.  It  calculates  the  relative  distance  between
solutions as follows:

(cid:1)1’(cid:6)

1’ = (cid:143)

(cid:3)

 |(cid:131)h|  ∑ @v(cid:18) − v̅A

|(cid:131)h|
(cid:18)e(cid:3)

(cid:5)

(29)

(cid:10)

|(cid:131)h|
(cid:18)e(cid:3)

⁄
v(cid:18) |W’|

  and  the  rest  of  solutions  on  both  objectives  and

where  PF  is  the  number  of  non-dominated  solutions  belonging  to  the  same  Pareto  front,  is  the
average  distance  between  a  solution

v̅ =
 is the average distance between all solutions on the two objectives. In our case, the
∑
objectives are not of the same magnitude. Thus, we normalized the values of two objectives over
the interval [0,1] before determining the SP metric. Knowing that this metric is to be minimized,
that  is  means  if  SP  is  low  (tends  to  0),  the  solutions  are  uniformly  spaced.  Therefore,  the
algorithm which allows to obtain the lowest value of SP is the better.
-  The Hypervolume metric
 is proposed by (Zitzler et al., 2003), that measures the quality
of the approximation in terms of convergence and diversity. It thus allows to calculate the multi-
dimensional  region  separating  a  Pareto  front  and  a  reference  point
.  The  algorithm  that
provides  a  large  value  of
,  implies  better  convergence.  To  calculate  the  hypervolume,  the
solutions are normalized on an interval [0,1]. This work deals with a minimization problem. So,
the  reference  point  is  determined  from  the  worst  values  obtained  (upper  bounds)  for  each
objective
.  The  hypervolume  is  therefore  can  be  determined  through  the
>(cid:140)(cid:142)Y = (cid:1)>̅(cid:3), >̅(cid:5)(cid:6)
following equation, Knowing that

(cid:1)>(cid:140)(cid:142)Y(cid:6)

(cid:1)(cid:145)(cid:146)(cid:6)

(cid:1)(cid:145)(cid:137)(cid:6)

:

(cid:145)(cid:146)(cid:1)’W, >(cid:140)(cid:142)Y(cid:6) = ∑ |>(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:10) + 1(cid:6) − >(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:6)|(cid:147)>(cid:5)

The  results  obtained  from  the  performance  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  4  It  indicates  for
each  instance,  the  minimum,  the  maximum  and  the  average  values  of  the  Spacing  (SP)  and
hypervolume (Hv) indicators. It should be noted that in this paper, the objectives are not of the
same  magnitude.  Thus,  they  have  been  normalized  on  the  interval  [0,1]  before  determining  the
performance  metrics.  According  to  Table  4,  the  average  hypervolume  value  obtained  by  K-
SPEA2 is higher than that obtained by K-NSGA-II, in 88.8% of instances. In addition, K-SPEA2
is better in terms of convergence and diversity compared to K-NSGA-II, in 39% of instances.

Therefore, it is clear to interpret that the Pareto fronts obtained by K-SPEA2 converge better
towards the optimal Pareto front. In addition, K-SPEA2 has a better distribution capacity that can
help it to convergence.

However, K-SPEA2 needs more time to find solutions, compared to K-NSGA-II. In fact, K-
SPEA2  takes  an  almost negligible  extra-time  (about  13.78  ms).  It  should  be  noted  that  the two
algorithms K-SPEA2 and K-NSGA-II are executed with small-size instances (clusters). Thereby,
K-NSGA-II requires 2 to 6 seconds, while K-SPEA2 needs 2 to 9 seconds to solve the problem.
By Comparing the two hybrid algorithms with their original versions, it can be seen that dividing
the  problem  into  sub-problems  saves  time  (about  3000  ms).  In  addition,  the  results  of
hypervolume  metric  are  illustrated  graphically  in  Figure  5,  using  box-plots.  So  that,  each  box
presents  for  each  test  instance,  the  20  hypervolume  values  obtained  from  the  20  runs.  By
observing the behavior of the boxes, we can easily notice that K-NSGA-II and K-SPEA2 are very
similar in terms of diversity in the most of instances. Nevertheless, the hypervolume values of K-







SPEA2  are  higher  than  those  of  K-NSGA-II  (in  60%  of  instances).  It  means  that,  K-SPEA2  is
better in terms of convergence. It should be noted that the best Pareto front should have the best
ratio  between  convergence  towards  the  optimal  front  and  the  diversity  of  non-dominated
solutions. Thus, a new weighted metric W is defined to measure both diversity and convergence
of  the  Pareto  fronts.  Knowing  that  PF  is  also  normalized  in  an  interval  [0,1]  before  calculating
this metric.

(31)

u = (cid:148) |’W| + (cid:149) (cid:1)1 − 1’(cid:6) + (cid:150) (cid:145)(cid:146)
where

 and

(cid:150)

:

(cid:149)

(cid:148) + (cid:149) + (cid:150) = 1

 have the same value. For each test instance, the best Pareto
,
(cid:148)
front (Pareto subset) is the one with the highest value of
. Once this metric is determined for all
clusters, the best Pareto subsets have to be combined to form the global Pareto front. Thus, the
output  of  the  combination  stage  is  a  global  Pareto  front.  As  the  combination  phase  is  done  20
times with both algorithms K-NSGA-II and K-SPEA2, we have obtained 20 global Pareto fronts
by each of them. Now, in order to evaluate the performance of K-NSGA-II, K-SPEA2 and their
original versions NSGA-II and SPEA2, we have done a performance study, presented by Table 5
through the previously used metrics.

u

According  to  the  found  results,  it  is  observed  that  the  hypervolume  results  obtained  by
SPEA2 are better (in 83% of instances) compared to those obtained by NSGA-II. Therefore, we
can interpret that SPEA2 provides better convergence compared to NSGA-II.

On the other hand, good performance is obtained by NSGA-II in terms of SP metric (in 66%



of instances). Thus, the solutions of the Pareto fronts obtained by NSGA-II are evenly spaced and
better  distributed  compared  to  those  found  using  SPEA2.  Moreover,  it  is  noticed  that  both
algorithms K-NSGA-II  and K-SPEA2 also have  good performance in terms of SP compared to
their  original  version.  In  average,  the  SP  values  obtained  by  K-SPEA2  vary  between  0.13  and
0.23, while those obtained by K-NSGA-II vary between 0.19 and 0.29. Furthermore, the average
hypervolume values obtained by SPEA2 vary between 0.75 and 0.98, while those found with K-
SPEA2  vary  between  0.8  and  0.97.  It  means  that  both  versions  of  SPEA  provide  better
convergence  towards  the  optimal  Pareto  front.  However,  K-SPEA2  slightly  exceeds  SPEA2  in
terms of convergence, with an average deviation of 5%, but they are similar in terms of diversity.
However, K-NSGA-II and K-SPEA2 are similar in terms of convergence and diversity.

In  order  to  validate  the  performance  of  the  four  algorithms,  a  statistical  analysis  has  been
carried  out  through  a  non-parametric  test,  namely  "Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test".  The  statistical
analysis  is  necessary  to  draw  reliable  conclusions  about  the  performance  of  multi-  objective
algorithms. For each test instance, 20 hypervolumes and 20 values of SP are founded by NSGA-
II, SPEA2, K-NSGA-II and K-SPEA2.

Let’s remember that all algorithms share the same parameters for all runs, such as population
size, crossover and mutation rates, etc. Thus, a pairwise comparison is performed, as explained in
(Wilcoxon, 1992) and (Harris & Hardin, 2013) with a probability value
. The
pairs  of  algorithms  are  compared  according  to  the  hypervolume  and  the  SP  metrics.  Therefore,
the  statistical  test  indicates  for  each  test  instance  and  depending  on  the  indicator  considered,
whether a given algorithm is significantly better than the other algorithm or there is no significant
difference between them. The test results are shown in Table 6. For each instance and according
to  the  performance  indicator,  either  the  algorithm  located  at  a  given  row  is  significantly  better
(**)  than  that  in  a  given  column,  or  it  is  significantly  worse  (x),  or  there  is  no  significant
difference between them (||).

As discussed before, the hybrid algorithms are similar in term of performance. SPEA2 and K-
SPEA2 are always better in terms of convergence but they require more time to give solutions to
the  problem.  While  NSGA-II  and  K-NSGA-II  are  the  faster  in  computation  and  offer  good
performance  in  terms  of  convergence  and  diversity.  Also,  it  is  observed  that  the  new  hybrid
algorithms  K-NSGA-II  and  K-SPEA2  are  faster  than  their  original  versions  when  dividing  the
considered problem into sub-problems. Nevertheless, in the overall process, they take more time
to provide global solutions to the problem. Table 7 summarizes the best founded solutions of all
algorithms. By comparing the founded results with those of lexicographical method, it is clear to
observe  that  Pareto  methods  provide  decision  makers  with  a  set  of  best  solutions  in  a  single
algorithm run. They also allow to widen the search space thanks to the evolutionary process and
therefore, offer a better  convergence towards the optimal solutions. Unlike Pareto methods, the
lexicography method provides a unique solution to the problem, favoring one objective over the
others.  However,  it  requires  much  more  time  to  solve  the  problem  (between  100  and  500
seconds) compared to the other algorithms. For all these reasons, we can conclude that the Pareto
methods  are  more  efficient  than  the  lexicography  method  to  solve  the  considered  the  problem,
and  that  the  hybrid  algorithms  K-NSGA-II  and  K-SPEA2  have  succeeded  in  improving  the
quality of the Pareto fronts, thanks to the K-means clustering technique.

6.  Conclusion

In this paper, a new bi-objective mathematical model is proposed to deal with the HHCRSP,
which aims to minimize both total service time and the difference between ser- vices’ start times
and visiting-time preferences. Three methods are proposed to solve the problem. The first one is
called  Lexicographical  method  that  belongs  to  the  non-scalar  resolution  methods  while  the
second  and  the  third  ones  belong  to  Pareto  method.  In  fact,  two  well-known  MOEAs  namely
NSGA-II  and  SPEA2  are  implemented  to  solve  the  problem,  then  they  are  combined  with  the
well-known  K-means  clustering  method,  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  obtained  Pareto
fronts.  All  proposed  approaches  are  evaluated  through  test  instances,  taken  from  the  VRPTW
Solomon’s Benchmark. According to the experimental results, it is observed that K-SPEA2 has a
better  performance  than  SPEA2  by  8%  of  GAP  in  term  of  convergence  and  by  6%  of  GAP
regarding the diversity indicator. While K-NSGA-II has 22% of GAP compared to NSGA-II in
term of diversity and a GAP of 1.4% regarding the convergence indicator. By comparing Pareto
methods with lexicographical method, it is clear to interpret that NSGA-II, SPEA2, K-NSGA-II
and K-SPEA2 are faster in execution time than lexicographical method and provide the decision
makers more than a single solution in just one run of the algorithm. The experimental results also
prove  the  efficiency  and  the  suitable  of  MOEAs  in  terms  of  CPU  time  and  the  quality  of
solutions facing the HHC-MOVRPTW.
